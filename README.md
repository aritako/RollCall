This project uses the React library and the Ionic + Capacitor framework. Ionic is a UI framework that provides a wide range of components and features for building mobile apps, while Capacitor is a runtime that allows Ionic apps to be deployed to both iOS and Android devices.

To get started, we install Ionic through `npm`:
```
npm i -g @ionic/cli
```
To run the project in your local development server for app development and testing, i.e. through `localhost`:
```
ionic serve
```
## Simulation on Android Device
